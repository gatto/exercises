# my exercises

Some exercises I did for the Data Science MSc @Unipi.

I decided to publish these exercises in the (perhaps unlikely) case that someone will draw some inspiration from them or that they want to try to solve them.

## What you will find in this repo

Each folder is dedicated to a subject I took.

In each folder you will find:

- a `README.md` with the title and text of each exercise, and
- a solution file for each exercise, for instance `permutations.py`.

If you want to try to solve anything yourself, open the `README.md` before looking at the python ðŸ™‚

## List of subjects

- [Programming](https://github.com/gatto/exercises/tree/main/pds) for data science
- [Algorithms & Data Structures](https://github.com/gatto/exercises/tree/main/algos) for data science
- more to come!

## What I am focusing on

**Learning**. I try to write solutions that are simple, clear, straigthforward. As these are done to learn and not strictly to get the best performance, I am sure that all of my solutions can be improved in that regard. However, I should not be doing something that is *awful* performance-wise.

## Please open issues if

- you've got a more straightforward solution!
- you found a more efficient solution which **is not** less clear;
- there's a new way to do something;
- I've made a mistake, including any corner cases.

## Style guide

- I'm using [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black) which is fantastic;
- and [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) which is not, but is kinda necessary.

## Thanks to

All my colleagues @ MSc Data Science [@Unipisa](https://github.com/Unipisa) for their help, their collaboration, suggestions, encouragement, teaching, inspiration.
